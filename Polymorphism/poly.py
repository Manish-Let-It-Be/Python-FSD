POLYMORPHISM in PYTHON


poly : many; morphs: forms 

> Having multiple forms
> allows us to do the same activity in a variety of ways

# Implementaions methods:
> Overloading of operators/functions
  Same operator performs various operations depending on the operands

a = 10
b = 20
print('Addition of 2 numbers:', a + b)

str1 = 'Hello '
str2 = 'Python'
print('Concatenation of 2 strings:', str1 + str2)

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['A', 'B']
print('Concatenation of 2 lists:', list1 + list2)

> Class Polymorphism in Python
> Method overriding, also referred to as Run time Polymorphism
> Method overloading, also known as Compile time Polymorphism
